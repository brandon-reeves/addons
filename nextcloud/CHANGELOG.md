## Deprecated
This add-on is now deprecated and will not receive any more updates. The upstream container has changed considerably and it is beyond my level of expertise/time commitment to make it work again. I suggest migrating to the Nextcloud add-on in [this](https://github.com/alexbelgium/hassio-addons) repository, which is already updated to the latest version, and has many more configuration options. This add-on will likely continue to work for some time.
