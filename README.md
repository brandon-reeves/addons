hopefully useful hassio addons

## Note
I have an x86 Debian machine. All testing is done on this machine. If you run a differet architecture and have issues, please report them but be prepared to help test.

## Update
I no longer personally use HAOS. I will try and keep these updated, but if it breaks significaly I may not be able to debug and repair.
